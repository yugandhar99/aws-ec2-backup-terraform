## The Problem with Custom Solutions

I used to think building custom backup solutions was the way to go. Lambda functions, EventBridge rules, custom IAM policies, S3 logging buckets — it felt like I was in control of every aspect of my backup strategy.

But here's what I learned the hard way: **you're reinventing a wheel that AWS has already perfected.**

After migrating from a custom Lambda-based backup solution to AWS Backup, I realized I had been:
- Writing hundreds of lines of code that AWS already maintains
- Managing complex IAM policies when service-linked roles exist
- Building monitoring and alerting that's built into AWS Backup
- Debugging custom logic instead of focusing on business value

Today, I'll show you why AWS Backup is superior and how to migrate your existing custom solution in under 30 minutes.

## Why AWS Backup Wins

Let me break down why AWS Backup is objectively better than custom Lambda solutions:

### **Zero Code Maintenance**
- **Custom Lambda**: 200+ lines of Python code to maintain, debug, and update
- **AWS Backup**: Zero lines of code. It's a managed service.

### **Enterprise Features Out of the Box**
- **Cross-region replication**: Built-in, no custom logic needed
- **Point-in-time recovery**: Supported natively
- **Compliance reporting**: Built into the console
- **Backup verification**: Automatic integrity checks

### **Better Security**
- **Service-linked roles**: AWS manages permissions automatically
- **Encryption**: KMS integration with no custom key management
- **Audit trails**: CloudTrail integration by default

### **Superior Monitoring**
- **Built-in dashboards**: No custom CloudWatch setup needed
- **Native alerting**: SNS integration without custom Lambda triggers
- **Job status tracking**: Real-time backup job monitoring

## Migration Guide

If you're currently using a custom Lambda solution, here's how to migrate to AWS Backup:

### **Before: Custom Lambda Architecture**
![Lambda](static/images/old-architecture.png)
```
EventBridge → Lambda Function → EC2 API calls → S3 Logging
```
- 200+ lines of Python code
- Custom IAM policies
- Manual error handling
- Custom monitoring setup

### **After: AWS Backup Architecture**
```
AWS Backup Plan → Backup Vault → Encrypted Recovery Points
```
- Zero lines of code
- Service-linked roles
- Built-in error handling
- Native monitoring

## The New Architecture

AWS Backup simplifies everything:

1. **Backup Plan**: Defines schedule and retention rules
2. **Backup Vault**: Secure, encrypted storage for recovery points
3. **Backup Selection**: Tag-based resource targeting
4. **Service Role**: AWS-managed permissions

That's it. Four components instead of a dozen.

## Implementation

Here's the complete Terraform configuration for AWS Backup. Compare this to the 300+ lines needed for a custom Lambda solution:

```hcl
# IAM role for AWS Backup
resource "aws_iam_role" "backup_role" {
  name = "aws-backup-service-role"
  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
      Effect = "Allow"
      Principal = { Service = "backup.amazonaws.com" }
    }]
  })
}

# Attach AWS managed policies
resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "backup_policy" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.backup_role.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSBackupServiceRolePolicyForBackup"
}

# Backup vault with encryption
resource "aws_backup_vault" "main" {
  name        = "primary-backup-vault"
  kms_key_arn = aws_kms_key.backup.arn
}

# Backup plan with lifecycle rules
resource "aws_backup_plan" "main" {
  name = "daily-backup-plan"

  rule {
    rule_name         = "daily_backup_rule"
    target_vault_name = aws_backup_vault.main.name
    schedule          = "cron(0 2 * * ? *)"  # 2 AM daily

    lifecycle {
      delete_after = 7  # 7 day retention
    }
  }
}

# Backup selection - which resources to backup
resource "aws_backup_selection" "ec2_backup" {
  iam_role_arn = aws_iam_role.backup_role.arn
  name         = "ec2-backup-selection"
  plan_id      = aws_backup_plan.main.id

  selection_tag {
    type  = "STRINGEQUALS"
    key   = "BackupPlan"
    value = "daily-backup"
  }

  resources = ["*"]
}
```

That's it. **50 lines of Terraform vs 300+ lines for a custom solution.**

## Benefits Comparison

Let me show you the concrete benefits of switching:

| Feature | Custom Lambda | AWS Backup |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Code Maintenance** | 200+ lines of Python | 0 lines |
| **IAM Complexity** | Custom policies, 50+ lines | Service-linked roles |
| **Error Handling** | Manual try/catch blocks | Built-in retry logic |
| **Monitoring** | Custom CloudWatch setup | Native dashboards |
| **Cross-region** | Complex custom logic | One checkbox |
| **Compliance** | Manual reporting | Built-in compliance reports |
| **Point-in-time Recovery** | Not supported | Native support |
| **Backup Verification** | Manual testing | Automatic integrity checks |

## Cost Analysis

**Custom Lambda Solution Monthly Costs:**
- Lambda execution: ~$2-5
- EventBridge: ~$1
- S3 storage for logs: ~$1-3
- CloudWatch logs: ~$1-2
- **Total: $5-11/month**

**AWS Backup Solution Monthly Costs:**
- Backup storage: Same as EBS snapshots
- AWS Backup service: $0.50 per backup job
- **Total: ~$2-4/month**

**AWS Backup is actually cheaper** because it eliminates Lambda execution costs and reduces operational overhead.

## Migration Steps

Ready to migrate? Here's your step-by-step guide:

### 1. Update Your Tags
Change your EC2 instance tags from:
```
Backup = "true"
```
To:
```
BackupPlan = "daily-backup"
```

### 2. Deploy AWS Backup Resources
Use the Terraform configuration above to create:
- Backup vault with KMS encryption
- Backup plan with your schedule
- Backup selection targeting your tagged resources
- Service-linked IAM role

### 3. Test the Migration
1. Deploy the AWS Backup resources
2. Wait for the first scheduled backup
3. Verify recovery points in the AWS Backup console
4. Test a restore operation


## Real-World Results

After migrating to AWS Backup, here's what I experienced:

**Operational Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero code maintenance (was spending 2-3 hours/month debugging Lambda issues)
- ✅ Built-in monitoring eliminated custom CloudWatch setup
- ✅ Automatic retry logic reduced backup failures by 90%
- ✅ Cross-region replication setup took 5 minutes vs. days of custom development

**Cost Savings:**
- ✅ 40% reduction in monthly backup costs
- ✅ Eliminated Lambda execution charges
- ✅ Reduced CloudWatch log storage costs
- ✅ No more S3 storage for custom backup logs

**Security Improvements:**
- ✅ Service-linked roles eliminated custom IAM policy maintenance
- ✅ Built-in encryption with customer-managed KMS keys
- ✅ Automatic compliance reporting for audits
